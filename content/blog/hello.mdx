I've had many false starts in the world of blogging, so I'm gonna keep it short.

A few weeks back I wrote a [short article that I posted to dev.to](https://dev.to/vcanales/using-chart-js-in-a-function-component-with-react-hooks-246l).
It gained a small amount of traction, and it felt so good to have people immediately letting me know that it was helpful for them, that I felt inspired to
put down "start blogging again" on my to-dos. So, here we are!

Welcome :)
